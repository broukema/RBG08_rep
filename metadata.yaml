abstract: "The surface-of-last-scattering optimal cross-correlation method of finding a
           preferred orientation of the fundamental domain of the spatial section of the
           Universe, under the working hypothesis that the spatial section is a Poincaré
           dodecahedral space developed in earlier work, was published in 2008 (RBG08). The steps
           required to download the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) five-year data
           and the software code used in RBG08 and reproduce the main results of that paper
           are examined here to see if the earlier work is reproducible."
