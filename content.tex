\section{Introduction}

The aim in this paper is to reproduce the results that use the method described
in Section 3.2 and the observational analysis results described in Section 4.2,
displayed in Figs.~3, 4, 5 and given numerically in Tables 2 and 3.

\section{Method}

The steps used to try to reproduce the original results require reading of the appropriate
sections of RBG08.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Section 2.1\supercite{RBG08} states that the analysis method of Section 3.2 requires
  the three files at URLs listed in footnotes 1, 2, 3 on the same page. These files
  represent two versions of an all-sky map of the Universe mostly representing cosmic microwave background
  emission at 10{\hGpc} (comoving) from the Earth as observed by
  the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)\supercite{WMAP5Hinshaw}, and
  the ``kp2'' mask to enable analysis that avoids the most contaminated regions of
  the sky. These files are downloaded.
\item
  Footnote 7\supercite{RBG08} indicates that {\sc circles-0.3.2.1}, to be found at
  the URL \url{http://cosmo.torun.pl/GPLdownload/dodec/}, provides the software
  for generating the figures and tables. This software is downloaded as
  \url{http://cosmo.torun.pl/GPLdownload/dodec/circles-0.3.2.1.tar.gz}.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Results}

\subsection{Downloading data and software source code}

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  The URL in footnotes 1, 2 and 3\supercite{RBG08} gave clickable links that were split into
  two and not correctly clickable. The user needs to cut/paste the two halves of each URL
  in order to obtain the three data files. The data files were downloaded with no apparent
  problem, with md5sums as indicated in Table~\ref{t-md5sums}.
\item
  The file {\sc circles-0.3.2.1.tar.gz} with the md5sum indicated in Table~\ref{t-md5sums} was
  downloaded.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Compiling}

\textbf{TODO: comment on the hacks, GSL API change.}

\subsection{Running}

\textbf{TODO: comment on the lack of a specific script indicated in the paper; inside knowledge makes
  it easier to rederive an appropriate list of commands.}
